<!--
This file contains the shared codec definitions for all configurations of the
Progress Apama FIX Adapter.  These elements can be included in an IAF
configuration file using an XInclude directive as shown below:

	<codecs>
		<xi:include href="FIX-static-codecs.xml" xpointer="xpointer(//codec)" />
	</codecs>

In order to comply with the configuration file DTD, the <adapter-config>
element in the configuration file should else contain a "xmlns:xi" attribute
as shown below:

	<adapter-config xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">

Note that these definitions should not need to be modified and that any
modified configurations will not be supported unless the changes have been
approved by Progress Apama Technical Services.
